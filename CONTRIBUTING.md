## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * ‚ú® `:sparkles:` for new features
  * üêõ `:bug:` for bug fixes
  * üìù `:memo:` for documentation
  * üîß `:wrench:` for configuration changes
  * ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` for refactoring

### JavaScript Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style. Please ensure your code passes linting before submitting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use Markdown for documentation
* Follow the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) specification
* Reference other documents using relative links
* Document all public APIs and components

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

When making significant architectural decisions, please document them as ADRs:

1. Create a new ADR file using our template:
   ```bash
   npm run adr:new "decision-title"
   ```

2. Fill in the template with your decision details
3. Submit the ADR as part of your pull request

## Releasing Packages

Only maintainers can release new versions. The process uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets):

1. Create a changeset:
   ```bash
   npx changeset
   ```

2. Commit the changeset file
3. When ready to release:
   ```bash
   npm run publish-packages
   ```
