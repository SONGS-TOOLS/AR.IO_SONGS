# SONGS Protocol × Arweave/AR.IO

**Permanent, censorship-resistant music distribution with token-gated monetization**

## Project Overview

SONGS Protocol integrates Arweave and AR.IO technologies to create a permanent, decentralized platform for music distribution and monetization. This repository contains the implementation of storage integrations, token-gating mechanisms, and artist microsites.

## Documentation & Learning Resources

### Weekly Discovery Documents

We maintain a [collection of weekly discovery documents](./docs/weeklies) that chronicle the personal learning journey and implementation process. These documents provide:

- Step-by-step exploration of key technologies (ArNS, Astro, Arweave)
- Real-world implementation challenges and solutions
- Code snippets and examples from our exploration
- Valuable insights for developers new to the project

Current discovery topics include:
- [Week 1 Initial Setup and Full Docs Mapping](./docs/weeklies/week-1.md)

### Architecture Decisions

For formal design decisions, see the [Architecture Decision Records](./adr) (ADRs).

## Tech Stack

- **Storage**: Arweave "Permaweb" (permanent, pay-once storage)
- **Gateways**: AR.IO network with ArNS (human-readable names)
- **Upload**: Turbo SDK / Bundlr (high-throughput bundling)
- **Contracts**: ERC-1155 for token-gated content
- **Front-end**: React hooks, Astro for artist sites

## Milestones 
#### Milestones to develop during the exploration

This project is being implemented in 5 key milestones:

1. **M0**: Public research repository & knowledge base
2. **M1**: Core storage integration with AR.IO
3. **M2**: Token-gated high-fidelity audio access
4. **M3**: Reusable turbo-gated-storage package
5. **M4**: ARNS-powered artist sites
