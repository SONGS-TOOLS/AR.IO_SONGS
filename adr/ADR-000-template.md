# ADR-000: Template for Architecture Decision Records

## Status
`PROPOSED` | `ACCEPTED` | `DEPRECATED` | `SUPERSEDED by ADR-XXX`

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? Provide context for the problem, including any technical, business, or user experience considerations. This section should be factual and neutral.

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? This should clearly state the architectural decision being made and any key design details. This section should explain what we're doing, not why.

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? List both positive and negative implications of the decision, considering areas such as:

- Performance impact
- Security implications
- Developer experience
- Maintenance burden
- Compatibility with existing systems
- Future extension points

## Alternatives Considered
What other approaches did we consider, and why did we reject them? This helps provide context on the decision-making process and can be valuable if the decision needs to be revisited later.
