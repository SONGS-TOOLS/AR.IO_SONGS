# SONGS Protocol Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the SONGS Protocol implementation on Arweave/AR.IO.

## Directory Structure

- [`/weeklies`](./weeklies) - Weekly discovery documents chronicling the implementation journey
- `/workshops` - Materials from team workshops and discovery sessions
- `/research` - In-depth research on key technologies and approaches
- `/specs` - Technical specifications and requirements

## Weekly Discovery Documents

The [`/weeklies`](./weeklies) folder contains a chronological series of documents that follow the personal journey of implementing various aspects of the SONGS Protocol. These documents are particularly valuable for:

- New contributors wanting to understand the development process
- Developers looking for implementation examples
- Understanding the reasoning behind technical decisions
- Learning about challenges encountered and how they were solved

Start with the [weeklies README](./weeklies/README.md) to understand the structure and purpose of these documents.

## Architecture Decisions

For formal architecture decisions, see the [Architecture Decision Records](../adr) in the project root.

## Reference Documents

The document snapshots are also stored permanently on Arweave, with links available in the main [README](../README.md#-arweave-registry).
